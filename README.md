# STAT 545A Mini Data Analysis Project M1 & M2
**_Han Wang_**
## Project Description
  * **Four datasets:**
    - 1: building_permits
    - 2: cancer_sample
    - 3: steam_games
    - 4: vancouver_trees
  * **Dataset selection:**
       - I chose the cancer_sample data set for Milestone 1 from the four datasets above because it has numeric and category variables.
    It is also easy to use and the data is in a tidy format, we can use this dataset to find the factors which affect the cancer diagnosis.
  * How to Engage in the Project
       1. Git clone the GitHub repository to the local R studio
       2. _"Knit"_ the Milestone_1.Rmd/Milestone_2.Rmd file
       3. It will generate a Milestone_1.md/Milestone_2.md file
       4. Read through the generated md file that contains all the contents of the Mini Data Analysis Project (M1)
       5. The dataset I analyzed is _cancer_sample_ for Milestone 1.
